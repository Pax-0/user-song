afterwards there should be a new folder, navigate to it using `cd user-song` then: 

- Rename `config_example.json` to `config.json` and paste your discord bot token in the token variable.
- Run `npm install` in the console.
- Run the bot with `node index.js` *Or any other runtime you have installed.*
