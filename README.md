# User-song link bot

The bot will save a song, and play whenever the target user joins a voice channel

# Setup:
# Firstly clone this repo where you plan to have the bot hosted then:

1 - rename `config_example.json` to `config.json` and paste your discord bot token in the token variable.
2 - open a console in the main folder with this code in it, and run `npm i` in the console.
3 - run the bot with `node index.js` *Or any other runtime you have installed.*
