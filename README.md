# User-song link bot

The bot will save a song, and play whenever the target user joins a voice channel

# Setup:
- Firstly clone this repo where you plan to have the bot hosted then:

- Rename `config_example.json` to `config.json` and paste your discord bot token in the token variable.
- Open a console in the main folder with this code in it, and run `npm i` in the console.
- Run the bot with `node index.js` *Or any other runtime you have installed.*
